# Cleaning and tidying data

This is a script to clean and tidy the data set "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset".
See treadme.txt

To clean the train and the test data from the subdirs run cleanedData <- readAndFilter()
tidyDataSet(cleanedData) creates a tidy data set as the one uploaded.
